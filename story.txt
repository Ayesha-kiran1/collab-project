Once upon a time in a quiet village nestled between the hills, lived a curious young girl named Mira. She loved to explore the woods beyond the village, often bringing home strange stones, feathers, and even forgotten books.
One sunny afternoon, she stumbled upon a hidden path covered in ivy. With her heart racing, she followed it until it opened into a glowing meadow filled with blue fireflies and singing flowers.
At the center of the meadow stood a tree with silver leaves. When she touched its bark, it whispered her name.
From that day on, Mira visited the magical place often, but she never told anyone â€” some secrets are best kept between you and the trees.
